# All Women Inter-Varsity Hackthon for Women In Computer Science Society 
The event was hosted by University of Cape Town, University of Western Cape, Stellenbosch University and University of Kwazulu-Natal.

The problem statement was to choose a solution that would solve the COVID-19 impacts on the society in Education, Enterprenuership, Health Secure and Employment sector.
Teams were required to choose either one of the four impacts and provide as solution to the problem.
My team knights decides to build a platform that would:
  1.Connect businesses to potential employes thus solves the Enterprenuership problem
  2.Connect employees to potential employers thus solving Enterprenuership
  3.Teach students and workers some short online courses that would further their skills.A certificate would be offered at the end of each course
